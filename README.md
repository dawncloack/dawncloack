- 👋 Hi, I’m Dawncloack
- 
- 👀 After many years as a simultaneous interpreting in international organizations, I am looking at expanding my professional horizons, and I finished an electrical engineering degree.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, but my programming first love (and strong suit) is C. I am able to program in C as an OO language, not just process.
  And get this: I understand pointers. For real. Read it: https://dawncloack.wordpress.com/2020/01/23/simple-finite-state-machine-in-c/
  
- 💞️ I love embedded systems, PICs, Microcontrollers. The voices are calling me to learn assembly. For now I have set my sights on a less ambitious target: Python.
- 
- I am C2 fluent in 8 natural languages: Spanish, English, French, Russian, Italian, Bulgarian and Catalan. I know advanced German.
- 
- I have proven soft skills, because of my work as an interpreter in multicultural contexts and international organizations. I would be the perfect interface between the engineering and human sides of things.
